Initialization
11. Change interrupt change to ItoC only work when in Initiailzation mode

ItoC
(fixed) 1. oled does not work with BLINK_BLUE at the same time (ItoC and Emergency)
9. Array for countdown, add top line for '6' so it doesnt look like b

Climb
2. think about LIGHT_THRESHOLD pca9532_setLeds function logic
	- use i=light/18.75, led mask = 1<<i - 1 (check max i = 16)
3. check/ask calculation of net_acc, so much larger than acc treshold (update emergency as well)
4. maybe change temperature display to float round of? (update everywhere)
10. net acc / 64 instead, check that net acc = 1 when direction changed (90degree rotation)

Others
5. interrupt for light sensor???

Emergency
6. emergency mode duration does not update consistently per time interval
(fixed) 1. oled does not work with BLINK_BLUE at the same time (ItoC and Emergency)

Emergency over
7. change saued to array of inverted letters (in sauved function)
8. Configure Emergency over trigger buttons (currently emergency over triggered by sw3)
	- interrupt if sw4 && emergency mode, change state

UART Stuffzzzzz
