Initialization
(fixed) 11. Change interrupt change to ItoC only work when in Initiailzation mode

ItoC
(fixed) 1. oled does not work with BLINK_BLUE at the same time (ItoC and Emergency)
9. Array for countdown, add top line for '6' so it doesnt look like b

Climb
(fixed, to be checked) 2. think about LIGHT_THRESHOLD pca9532_setLeds function logic
	- use i=light/18.75, led mask = 1<<i - 1 (check max i = 16)
3. check/ask calculation of net_acc, so much larger than acc treshold (update emergency as well)
4. maybe change temperature display to float round of? (update everywhere)
(fixed, need to verify) 10. net acc / 64 instead, check that net acc = 1 when direction changed (90degree rotation)

Emergency
(somewhat fixed) 6. emergency mode duration does not update consistently per time interval
(fixed) 1. oled does not work with BLINK_BLUE at the same time (ItoC and Emergency)

Emergency over
7. change saued to array of inverted letters (in sauved function)
8. Configure Emergency over trigger buttons
	- interrupt if sw4 && emergency mode, change state (interrupt not really working)
	- to to set flag with interrupt, trigger if flag and sw4 pressed
	- delay in timing (22nd second)

UART Stuffzzzzz

ENHANCEMENT
- rotary tool to adjust sensor refresh rate
- rotary tool to adjust led brightness with PWM
- music playlist selector with joystick

Summary of Questions to ask:
1. what is the units of acceleration read by the sensor? Why /64? or /9.81? How to convert read data to g?
2. What is the consequence of entering systickhandler at a longer interval? Maybe enter every 0.5s?
3. what is interrupt for light sensor for???
4. how do interrupt save processor time since checking of state is still done in while loop?
5. How to change name of project and file and import demo proj after that?
